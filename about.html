<h4>About Jacqueline</h4>
<p>Jacqueline graduated from the University of Connecticut in 2017 with a BA in Political Science and Journalism. Her work as an MFA student in Digital Media &amp Design left her with an insatiable desire to engage in the intersections between the digital world and “doing good.” As a researcher of brand partnerships, she spent her first two semester looking at sponsored content in the publishing world and on social media, both of which were specific to lifestyle content (i.e. fashion, beauty, wellness). Moving into her thesis she felt a draw to the resurgence of the movement against sexual misconduct and assault and wanted to use her knowledge of brand partnerships to take a closer look at influencer marketing among those who were vocal about these issues.</p>

<p>A singer-songwriter herself, Jacqueline specifically studied musicians and entertainers for her thesis research and focused on case studies like Lady Gaga’s “‘Til It Happens To You,” Kesha’s “Praying,” and FLETCHER’s “I Believe You.” In the ways that these women took a stand against sexual violence, Jacqueline, too, wanted to stand in solidarity and do her part to contribute positively to this rapidly changing digital landscape.</p>

    <h4>Acknowledgements</h4>
    <p>Thank you to the inexplicably brave voices of those who chose not to be silent in the face of endless barriers, understanding that they may never see justice for themselves, but rather lending their stories and voices in an effort to see the day when victims of abuse can finally find justice.</p>

    <p>Those who were kind, and willing, enough to share their expertise and experiences with me: Megan Sykes, Michael Skolnik, Jessica Lá Rel and Tarana Burke.</p>

    <p>The voices (both metaphorically and musically) of the case studies: FLETCHER, Kesha and Jessica Lá Rel.</p>

    <p>The Digital Media & Design department and its incredible faculty. My thesis committee: Tom Scheinfeldt, Clarissa Ceglio, John Murphy and Marie Shanahan for keeping me focused and pushing me to make this project the very best version of itself. Anna Lindemann and my MFA cohort for their input on my survey. Heather Elliott-Famularo for pushing my exhibition to stand alone as its own, whole piece.</p>

    <p>My endlessly supporting family, all of whom gave me the thumbs up when I decided to go to graduate school despite all my peers moving to new cities and starting jobs. Jack Maffucci and Cat Boyce for their assistance with designing the recruitment material for the survey used to collect the data in this thesis (also, for listening and listening… and listening). Lesedi Graveline for her beautiful perspective when it pertains to studying issues that can, at times, weigh your spirit down.</p>

    <p>Taylor Swift and her $1.</p>
