<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<p>The movement against sexual misconduct and assault rapidly made its way through the entertainment industry, leading to the birth of organizations like “Times Up,” “It’s On Us” and others. In many cases, these nonprofits have partnered with entertainers to spread awareness for the cause. Through the use of influencer marketing, people like FLETCHER and Kesha have been able to share their personal stories of sexaul assault through their music while also teaming up with associated nonprofits to encourage their followers to get involved in the cause. This thesis will not only examine how these partnerships are formed, what kind of change occurs (if any) and to what extent social media acts as a catalyst for influencer-driven change, but also determine what attitudes exist about the movement against sexual misconduct and assault and where/how those conversations take place on social media.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTON</h3>
<h4>THESIS COMPONENTS</h4>
<p><strong>In-depth story:</strong> The first element of this thesis is the in-depth, journalistic-style story that describes how and why these partnerships form, what it means for the artist and how it all affects the public. Having collected the survey data and analyzed the selected case studies in the fall of 2018, it was important to synthesize all elements of this work into one, cohesive piece. As a former journalist, the qualitative aspect of this story was just as important as the quantitative and it became clear that there were stories to tell that extended well beyond numbers on a page or bars on a graph.</p>
<p><strong>Survey data and analysis:</strong> The second component of this thesis was a survey that analyzed the public’s attitudes and online participation as it pertains to the movement against sexual misconduct assault. The survey received over 500 participants from UConn and beyond. An advertisement of the survey was posted to Instagram and Twitter in order to garner more participants.</p>
<p><strong>Case studies:</strong> The case study work was, by far, the most challenging aspect of this thesis as social media analysis can be objective and there is no way to determine sales/campaign effect simply by looking at the likes on a post. The data for this aspect of the thesis was gathered using Talkwalker, a social media analytics platform. One of the goals of this component was to determine the lifespan of the campaigns and if there is any overlap in terms of engagement or sentiment.</p>
<p><span class="nav-ts"><strong>tailspin</span> (exhibition):</strong> “tailspin” is the exhibit that is located in The William Benton Museum of Art in Storrs, CT. It features two interactive components, located within a color-gel lit pink room. The first of which is a 36” monitor that displays this thesis website in order to allow visitors to browse this research before interacting with the second component. The participatory aspect of this exhibit ties in each aspect of this thesis. There are hundreds of mini “social media posts” from Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Among them are 15 different prompts related to this research (e.g. “what is something you wish you could say but don’t?”) that encourages visitors to engage with their vulnerable side. At “tailspin,” a visitor fills out one or more of these cards and hangs them on the flanking walls. In this way, the exhibit is living, breathing and always changing. When the exhibition is over, the cards will be removed from the walls, scanned and hosted on this website so that the archive of posts will continue to inspire future online visitors.</p>


<h3>GOALS &AMP OBJECTIVES</h3>

<ul>
<li> To understand the attitudes around the movement against sexual misconduct and assault</li> 
<li> To examine how people interact with the movement on social media</li> 
<li> To illustrate how and why partnerships between singers & non-profits form</li>
<li> To give people the opportunity to participate in an ongoing artifact related to this research</li>
</ul>

<h3>METHODOLOGY</h3>

<h4>IN-DEPTH STORY</h4>
<p>It was important that when writing the in-depth portion of this thesis that there was a well-rounded perspective on these issues. This story is bigger than just singers and non-profits. It’s more than just the music industry and the leaders of the movement against sexual misconduct and assault. Other actors are important to this story: mental health professionals, brand partnership agents and, most importantly, public opinion. The methodology behind the qualitative aspect of this research was intentionally designed to give as full of a picture as possible, during the seven-ish months in which this project was developed.</p>

<h4>SURVEY DATA &AMP ANALYSIS</h4>

<p>The “data” portion of this thesis was collected using a survey that received close to 500 responses. It was constructed using the platform Qualtrics and distributed using UConn’s listserv, social media advertising and word of mouth. There were no demographic, geographic or psychographic limits placed on this survey as there are no limits placed on those who have a relevant perspective on the movement against sexual misconduct and assault</p>
<p>The language “movement against sexual misconduct and assault” was used in replacement of the “me too. movement” or even the “movement against sexual violence” as not all sexual misconduct is violent and the “me too. movement” started in 2006 with a mission that differs from what it represents now. When founder Tarana Burke started the movement, it was intended to be a place for women of color from low-wealth communities to share their experiences of sexual harassment and assault. Since October of 2017, it has been used in reference to folks of all demographic backgrounds who have experienced sexual misconduct or assault, gender discrimination or intimate partner violence. Because of the breadth of the meaning of “me too.” the language “movement against sexual misconduct and assault” was used to narrow the focus of the research. </p>
<p>Questions in this survey ranged from multiple choice, multiple response, ranking questions, Likert matrix and fill in the blank. The beginning part of the survey probes at the participant’s political and issue-based affiliations. The second part asks the participants to determine where they saw news about the movement both on social media and otherwise. The third part asks if and where the participant has interacted with the movement in person and/or online. The fourth part uses a Likert scale to determine the participant’s attitudes and opinions about the movement and its affiliated issues. The fifth part asks the participant about involvement and activism within the movement and the final component asks various demographic questions (age, gender identity, race).</p>
<p>The two fill in the blank questions in this survey were found at the end. The two prompts were “what is your gender identity?” and “what is your race?”. These questions were left open-ended in an attempt to avoiding “othering” respondents by asking them to select an answer that did not truly represent their identity (e.g. responses for “what is your gender identity” are typically listed in a multiple choice format and include “male,” “female” and “other” with an option to fill in what “other” represents to that respondent.). By leaving the questions open-ended it allowed for respondents to identify themselves as who they are, not attempt to fit themselves into the mold of the survey. In this way, however, it forced the researcher to categorize the qualitative responses in a way that allowed the data to be cross referenced with other questions (i.e. “what is your gender” and “are you registered to vote?”). This was done by assigning a tag to responses that fell into the same category (i.e. women, she/her, cisgender woman, female, F were all selected as “Female”). Responses that fell outside of “Male” and “Female” were categorized as “Other” and the distinctions within that category are listed in the appendix.</p>

<h4>CASE STUDIES</h4>

<p><strong>FLETCHER’S</strong> “I Believe You” was written and dedicated to the victims and survivors of sexual misconduct and assault. This case study was selected because of its unique message and partnership with “Time’s Up” and “It’s On Us.”</p>
<p><strong>KESHA’S</strong> “Praying” was selected as one of the case studies because of its popularity in recent American culture; Kesha’s then ongoing lawsuit and experience with producer Dr. Luke is said to be the inspiration for this song. The partnership between Kesha and various organizations through the marketing of this song made it a good fit for this research.</p>
<p><strong>JESSICA LÁ REL’S</strong> “After War” is a song Lá Rel wrote about wanting to pin hope into her own heart after her experience with sexual assault. Her partnership with “me too.” and voice in the movement is a cornerstone of this research.</p>
